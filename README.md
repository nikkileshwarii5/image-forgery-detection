# Image-Forgery-Detection By Fusion of Light-Weight Deep Learning Models
This project leverages the power of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, and ShuffleNet for image forgery detection. By fine-tuning these models on the MICC-F220 dataset, consisting of both forged and authentic images, I have extracted high-quality features that significantly enhance detection accuracy. These extracted features are then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which demonstrates superior performance in distinguishing between forged and genuine images compared to traditional methods.
