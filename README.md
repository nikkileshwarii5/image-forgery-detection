# image-forgery-detection
This project detects an image forgery using fine-tuned features from light weight algorithms such as SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet and then extracted features are getting trained with SVM and then this SVM model is  giving better prediction accuracy compare to light weight algorithms.
Due to increasing technology various tools exists to tamper image and then tampered image can cause serious issues in LAW and other fields and to detect such tamper many existing algorithms are available based on SURF, PCA, SIFT and many more but this existing technique detection accuracy is not good so author training all 3 algorithms on MICC-F220 FORGE and NORMAL images and then extract fine-tuned features from them and this fined tuned features can be classified with SVM as FORGE or NON-FORGE.
